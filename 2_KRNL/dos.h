//      - Divide by zero

//              - unhandled and NOT reflected to RM
//              - Unless set in PM, will fail!
//      - Stack segment fault
//              - Similar to a #GP. Should work

//      - General protection fault:
//              - Only if the OS does not handle it.
//              - Recommended for segfaults
//              - Also sent if a coprocessor overrun happens, even on 80387
//
//      - Floating point exception (even with 80387, same one)
//      - SIMD stuff:
//              - Not sure what you're going to do with these
//              - Should technically work
//              - The kernel must support SIMD. Not currently the case.
//
// NOT SUPPORTED:
//
//      - Alignment check
//              - This must be enabled in a control register. It is not

//      - Page fault
//              - DPMI 1.0 permits this, though it is not required.
//              - OS/90 has its own way of handling page faults.
//              - Not supported.
