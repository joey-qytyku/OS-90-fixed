# OS/90 User Shell

QS.EXE is the command interpreter of the OS/90 userspace. It is cross-platform and fast.

## Syntax Description

QS does not use a real lexer or an abstract syntax tree. It simply expects tokens to be there and has defined methods of getting them. The interpreter can eat tokens or it can peek to the next one only.

The first space/tab/newline separated alphanumeric word (can start with number) is always expected to be a command. It is always an external command.

Internal commands of api features require the use of the equal sign operator, kind of like a spreadsheet.

Polish notation is used for all expressions.

## Types

## Example Program

```
=printf + "Hello " + @0=GetArgs "!\n\r"

```
