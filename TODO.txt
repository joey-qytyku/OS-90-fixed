Update header files and resource.c/h
V86 interface
Memory manager (per-process memory mapping and VMEM)

Should memory mapping use handles? Unix uses the address of the mapping.

Changing CR3 will always flush the cache.

If there is no FPU, coprocessor not present should terminate the process.

Add resource reserve feature (from Win95)

Sending interrupts to a multitasking DOS task?

When the page table is changed in the i386, the entire TLB must be invalidated.
On the i486 and above, the pages modified can be evicted from the TLB using INVLPG

======== 2023 Todo ========

* Finish exception handler code
* Test virtual 8086 mode

I need to have the differentiate parameter because the ISR is zero when there is a spurious interrupt. Do not change the current structure of the dispatcher.

Exceptions are now dispatched with a branch table. This is simpler and saves code size. The lower half handlers are apparently very complicated so I cannot just repeat them.

Leave the IOPB. I need it for V86. Or not?

I can merge DOS.c with Scheduler.

Am I linking old object files?

Look for anything that has a macro minus one. That is sus.

The for condition represents the count, not the limit of the index.

Now I need a proper plan so that I can finish OS/90 at some point and not turn it into a time sink.

The steps I will take:
* Get V8086 to work
* Get interrupt captures to work
* Make the scheduler and interrupt handling to work

== 2 May 2023

I must admit that I have a SERIOUS code quality problem in Scheduler.c. It is a complete mess. Maybe the comment subsections that I made are only creating more problems. It is time that I separate the file. V86 can stay in the same file, but other things have to go elsewhere.
