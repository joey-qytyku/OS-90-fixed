%if 0

This file handles IRQs and dispatching system events.

OS/90 does not use software interrupts directly. Every IDT entry is set to
ring-0 in order to make ring-3 emulation of all events possible by causing
a fault every time an INT call or anything like that happens.

Actual exceptions are different and are not actually called by software, but
the CPU and can work with ring-0.

Exceptions are used to emulate everything, if it originates from ring-3.
A chain of handlers is used.

---

IRQs start at vector 0xA0. They are completely reserved vectors that
may not be used for anything ever.

The low-level handlers simply jump to the middle part unless they are
7 or 15, in which case they write those values.
