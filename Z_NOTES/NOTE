I should remember that disabling interrupts to make a procedure safe to
call within an interrupt handler is a good idea for some things.

I can take advantage of this for ATM/90 to implement IO processing.

Windows allows PostMessage to be called within an IRQ handler for example.
This allows a keyboard or mouse IRQ to send a message or event.

I should incorporate this into ATM. Getting and posting events should be done
with IRQs off.

Posting is not the same as handling though. We do not want to mess up the
thread safety.
