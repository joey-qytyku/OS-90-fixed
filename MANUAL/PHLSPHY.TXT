================================================================================
	The Design Philosphy of OS/90
================================================================================

Modular design, flat layout, independent components.
No "big interface" for components to communicate.
Everything works out of the box.
Features are cringe. They just increase development time.
Flat is better than nested.
Do not worry about tidying-up already working code
