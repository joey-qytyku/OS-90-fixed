- Over 2GB of RAM available
- DPMI and DOS program compatibility
- 16-bit driver compatibility

Many people still programming for DOS are focused on making modern things work on it that would never work on a machine intended to actually run DOS. For example, XMS managers that can access multiple gigabytes of memory, real mode USB drivers, SATA and UDMA support, etc. OS/90 is not this way. It is meant to run on 32-bit computers from the entire 90's generation of computers or before that as long as it has a 386.

The majority of the code is written by myself. I follow the copyright laws of the United States.

Without the help of the following people, OS/90 would not have been possible:

Terry A. Davis, for inspiring me to learn about operating systems.

Marc Perkel, for the HTML version of Ralf Brown's Interrupt List. I used his work to make something kool!

- Ralf Brown, Principal Systems Scientist of Carnegie Mellon, for his valueable documentation.

- Ralph Lipe, for designing Win386, which inspired OS/90.
