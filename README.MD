Many people still programming for DOS are focused on making modern things work on it that would never work on a machine intended to actually run DOS. For example, XMS managers that can access multiple gigabytes of memory, real mode USB drivers, SATA and UDMA support, etc. OS/90 is not this way. It is meant to run on 32-bit computers from the entire 90's generation of computers or before that as long as it has a 386.
