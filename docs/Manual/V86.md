# Virtual 8086 Mode

- HV86
- V86_ATE
- V86_REFLECT
- VOID INTxH(BYTE x, PSTDREGS r)
- VOID RUNxH(BYTE x, PSTDREGS r)
- VOID HOOKxH(BYTE x, HV86 *old_to, HV86 new)

These are the basic services provided by the kernel for controlling requests to the BIOS or DOS from protected mode.

There exist a chain of handlers for each INT call. The chain starts from the very end and approaches the begining. It returns the old handler to chain back, returns `V86_PM_DONE` if handled in full within protected mode, or V86_PM_REFLECT to send it to real mode unconditionally.

The V86 hook handler takes a PSTDREGS structure. The `v86_` prefixed members are to be used.

If reflected, SV86 is entered and preemption is 100% disabled. The only things that will run are the real mode code and the general protection fault handler.

If SV86 makes a further call using INT, it will be handled with the chain, but the SV86 handler is required to check the preemption status.

Anything that tries to acquire a lock when SV86 is active will be dangerous. The context is not T1, but a special SV86 context type.

## VOID INTxH(BYTE x, PSTDREGS r)

This is the general interface.


## Example

Here is an example of monitoring the input to a call without changing the parameters. In the case of doing so (for whatever reason) ensure that the context is not clobbered incorrectly.
```
static HV86 old;

HV86 Handler(PSTDREGS r)
{
	if (AH(r) == 0xE) {
		kprint("Printing character %x", AL(r));
		return V86_REFLECT;
	}
	else
		return old;
}

VOID DriverMain(VOID)
{
	HOOKxH(0x10, &old, Handler);
}

```
## Advice

SV86 is always slower than a capture handler. Anything done in 32-bits will be faster.
