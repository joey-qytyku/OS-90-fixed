# Virtual Memory

The memory manager provides functions related to the management of swap files, demand paging candidacy hints, and other features.

## Swap Files

OS/90 has disk-mapped paging, allowing for pages in virtual memory to map to a sector or group of sectors on the disk. This is controlled by the disk driver primarily.
