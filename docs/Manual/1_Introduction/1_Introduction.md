# Introduction

This book documents the API provided by the OS/90 kernel and specifies a number of key interfaces, data structures, and behaviors that are expected from certain system components. For implementation details, consult some of the mardown documents, source code comments, or the journal in the project root directory.

## Getting Started

OS/90 is compiled using Open Watcom. Build scripts exist for UNIX and Windows/DOS.
